#
# This file defines how this project is built by evergreen at
#
#   https://evergreen.mongodb.com/waterfall/genny
#
# 1. Indent using 2 spaces. Structures start on indents (e.g. dashes aren't
#    indented). Don't quote unnecessarily.
#
# 2.  Use `f_` prefix for function names and `t_` prefix for task names.
#
#     This allows
#
#     1.  grep for all usage of a function/task without colliding with
#         inline shell etc.
#     2.  grep for definition of a function `FOO` by grepping for `f_FOO:`
#         (with a colon)
#
# 3.  Put comments in yaml not in inline shell.
#
# 4.  Keep yaml anchors/aliases to a minimum and always prefix with `a_`
#     for similar grep-ability. Favor functions and tasks with
#     dependencies.
#
# 5.  Always use functions for all task-bodies and pre/post-bodies rather
#     than inlines. This keeps the overall logic separate from the
#     implementation.
#
# 6.  Maintain one blank line between each unit (each function, task,
#     variant etc). Two lines between each section.
#
# 7.  Don't change the order of the sections. Goal is to start with "entry
#     points" (variants) and then define children in breadth-first order.
#
# 8.  Functions that are non-obvious must have a comment with the existing
#     comment style.
#
# 9.  Any function that requires parameters or `${}`-style expansions must
#     document those parameters appropriately such that callers don't need
#     to read the function definition to figure out what they mean.
#
