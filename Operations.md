Operations
==========

These are basic operations, such as a find_one. These operations *do*
something. The largest class of operations are crud operations. The
goal is to support all CRUD spec operations.


### CRUD Operations

#### Supported Operations

* Collection operations
  * count: Takes a document in the _filter_ field 
  * create\_index: document _keys_ and index options _options_ 
  * delete\_many: document _filter_ and delete options _options_
  * delete\_one: document _filter_ and delete options _options_
  * distinct: document _filter_ and distinct options _options_
  * drop: drops current collection
  * find: document _filter_ and find options _options_
  * find\_one: document _filter_ and find options _options_
  * find\_one\_and\_delete: document _filter_ and find and delete options _options_
  * find\_one\_and\_replace: document _filter_, replacement document
    _replace_,  and find and replace options _options_
  * find\_one\_and\_update: document _filter_, update document
    _update_,  and find and update options _options_
  * insert\_many: This operates two ways. Both have insert options _options_
    * field _container_ with a list of documents to insert
    * field _doc_ with one document, and field _times_ for the number
      of times to insert the document. This is a convenience option
      for building the container of documents. 
  * insert\_one: document _doc_ to insert and insert options _options_
  * list\_indexes: Calls list indexes. Doesn't take any options
  * name: Gets the collection name. Doesn't take any options
  * read\_preference: set the default read preference
    _read\_preference_ on the collection
  * replace\_one: document _filter_, replacement document
    _replacement_,  and update options _options_
  * update\_many: document _filter_, update document
    _replacement_,  and update options _options_
  * update\_one: document _filter_, update document
    _replacement_,  and update options _options_
  * write\_concern: set the default _write\_concern_ on the collection
* Database operations
  * command (needs to be renamed run\_command). Takes an arbitrary document _command_ and executes it
  * create\_collection: Create collection with string name
    _collection\_name_ and create collection options _options_
* Helper operations
  * set\_variable: Set a workload or thread variable. If an existing
  thread or workload variable exists, it will udpate that value. If
  there is no existing variable, it will be added to the thread
  variables (tvariables). The variable can be set from a _value_ or
  from another variable (_donorVariable_), but not both. Can also set
  DBName and CollectionName. 
  * _target_: string value name of the variable to update
  * _value_: A json/yaml value to set the variable to
  * _donorVariable_: A variable to copy a value from.
  
#### Future Operations

* Aggregation
* Remaining database operations
* Value/Doc manipulation operations: These are for constructing or
  changing values or documents. There is currently some support in
  overrideDocument, but it needs to be generalized. 

#### Other Future support

* The operations should return a value that is propogated in the
  thread state. This will feed in with choice nodes, and document
  manipulation.
