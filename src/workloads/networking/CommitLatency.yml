# All of the below is really just the same actor, but as Genny reports statistics using the actor
# name, we need a different actor instance for each configuration. All of the below run in their
# own slot, nothing is concurrent.
# Since Drop+Reload is in phases 0,1,-,3,4,-... then the test itself must always be in a slot at
# 2,5,8... = 3n-1 = 3n+2
